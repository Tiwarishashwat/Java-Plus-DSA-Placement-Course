# Non-Linear Data Structures – Mini Notes

## 1. What is a Data Structure?
A **data structure** is a way of organizing, storing, and managing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

---

## 2. Linear Data Structure
A **linear data structure** stores data elements in a **sequential (linear) manner**, where each element is connected to its previous and next element.

### Characteristics
- Elements are arranged in a single level
- Traversal is done in a single run (one by one)
- Memory can be contiguous or non-contiguous

### Examples
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue

### Real-life Example
A queue at a ticket counter where people stand one after another.

---

## 3. Non-Linear Data Structure
A **non-linear data structure** stores data elements in a **hierarchical or non-sequential manner**, where one element can be connected to multiple elements.

### Characteristics
- Elements are arranged in multiple levels
- Data is not stored sequentially
- Traversal requires specific techniques (DFS, BFS, etc.)

### Examples
- Tree
- Graph
- Heap
- Trie

### Real-life Example
A family tree or an organization hierarchy.

## 4. Linear vs Non-Linear Data Structures

| Feature | Linear Data Structure | Non-Linear Data Structure |
|------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Data Arrangement | Sequential | Hierarchical / Network |
| Levels | Single level | Multiple levels |
| Traversal | Simple (one-by-one) | Complex (DFS, BFS) |
| Relationship | One-to-one | One-to-many |
| Examples | Array, Stack, Queue | Tree, Graph |

## 5. When to Use Non-Linear Data Structures?
- When data has hierarchical relationships
- When fast searching, sorting, or relationship mapping is required
- When modeling real-world structures like networks, trees, or maps

---

## 6. Summary
- **Linear DS** → Simple, sequential data storage  
- **Non-Linear DS** → Complex, hierarchical or network-based storage  
- Choice depends on problem requirements and data relationships
